# Tic Tac Toe

A project built on React.
Introducing my newly created tic-tac-toe game! This classic two-player game has been given a modern twist with unique features and customizable options. Players aim to get three of their symbols in a row before their opponent does, on a 3x3 grid. Our game offers multiple difficulty levels and game modes, allowing players to challenge themselves and try out new strategies. The game features a sleek user interface with high-quality graphics and sounds. It was a challenging journey to create this game, but we are proud to offer an engaging and exciting experience for players of all ages. We look forward to continually improving and adding new features to the game in the future
